# D3-Simple-Bar-Chart

### Overview
This is a simple bar chart, again using the Iris datasource (strictly for simplicity).

### What I Learned
Aggregation using nest().
When aggregating - you essentially pick a key (and I believe you can nest keys) and then a value to aggregate using the entries function.  This file just does a simple mean, but using built in D3 functions and the abilities of Javascript there's technically no bounds.

### Running This File
I have a simple http server running - both the index.html file and the iris.csv have to be in the root for this to run
